### Web Penetration Testing
- Proficient in identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications using tools such as Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, and Nmap.
- Experience with manual testing techniques including SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and CSRF.
- Knowledgeable about common security misconfigurations and best practices for secure web development.

### Network Security
- Understanding of network protocols and architecture, including TCP/IP, DNS, DHCP, and VPN.
- Familiarity with network scanning and enumeration techniques to identify potential security risks.
- Experience with firewall configurations, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and network monitoring tools.

### Cryptography
- Knowledgeable about cryptographic algorithms and their implementations for data protection.
- Understanding of symmetric and asymmetric encryption, hashing, digital signatures, and key management.
- Experience with cryptographic protocols such as SSL/TLS and SSH.

## Project: Web Application Security Assessment Tool

Developed a web application security assessment tool using Python and Flask framework. The tool automates the process of scanning and identifying vulnerabilities in web applications, allowing security professionals to conduct thorough assessments efficiently. Key features include:
- Automated scanning of web applications for common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF.
- Integration with popular security testing tools such as Burp Suite and OWASP ZAP for comprehensive assessment.
- Reporting module to generate detailed vulnerability reports with remediation recommendations.
- Customizable scanning options and support for multiple testing methodologies.
- Ongoing development to incorporate new security testing techniques and stay updated with emerging threats.

This project provided hands-on experience in web application security testing and reinforced skills in vulnerability assessment, code analysis, and secure coding practices.
